# hb10_keys

Openscad script for HB10 keycaps. 

It includes, function keys, key stems, cursors, different height depending on row and retainers.

Upper parts are flat because it is easier for 3D printing.

It is recommended to print the keys laying on the top part (you can do that with prusa slicer). Thus, printing supports are not needed. :)

Enjoy it!
